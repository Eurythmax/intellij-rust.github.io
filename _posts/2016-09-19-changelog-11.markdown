## New Features

* `rustup` is used to download sources of the standard library for the nightly
  toolchain.
* Function signature is shown in quick doc (by [@allengeorge]).
* Better handling of string literals (by [@mkaput]):
    - <kbd>Enter</kbd> will automatically escape a new line,
    - closing quotes are inserted automatically for raw string literals.


## Fixes

* Fix resolve and highlighting for `char` and `str` (by [@kumbayo]).
* Fix run configurations for kebab-named targets.
* Correct retrieval of empty string attributes like `#[path=""]` (by [@mkaput]).


## Refactorings

* Switch to EAP version of Kotlin.
* `RustPath` is a fully decoupled from PSI representation of paths.
