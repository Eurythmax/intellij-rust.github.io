## New Features

* More accurate resolve with initial support for types and values namespaces.
  See [this thread][types-values-discussion] for the discussion about this
  feature of the Rust language.

* Display directory name in the tab title for `mod.rs` files (by [@mbStavola]).

* New inspections:
  - drop reference,
  - double negation,
  - suspicions assignment,
  - missing else,

  [@alygin] is on a roll!


* Join lines action works with string literals (by [@mkaput]).



## Fixes

* Better parser recovery for const and static items.


## Refactorings

* No code duplication in expression surrounders (by [@ujpv]).

* Simpler completion tests.
