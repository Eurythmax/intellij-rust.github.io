## New Features

* Goto class (`Ctrl+N`) works with type aliases.

* Various improvements to completion, including context-dependent keyword
  completion (by [@alygin]).

* Better diagnostics for parser errors (by [@alygin]).

* Support for `i128` / `u128` types (by [@alygin]).

* Highlight duplicate definitions (by [@alygin])

## Fixes

* Completion and resolve fixes.

* Introduce a variable (`Ctrl + Alt + V` or `a + b.let` and press tab)
  correctly works for several occurrences of the expression.

## Refactorings

* Developer docs are updated. Checkout the
  new
  [architecture](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md) section
  if you want to learn how the plugin works on the inside.

* More resolve is purely stub-based, which improves performance.

* Highlighter is rewritten not to touch AST to improve performance.
