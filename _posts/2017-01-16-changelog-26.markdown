## New Features

* Highlight duplicate lifetime declaration (by [@alygin]).

* Type inference for `?` operator.

* Support for `pub(crate)` syntax.

* Support for attributes on type parameters.

* **Simplify Boolean Expression** intention (by [@slavam2605]).

* **Run Configuration From Context** uses `--package` argument for multi-package
  workspaces.


## Fixes

* Quick fixes now correctly handle read-only files.

* Correctly color `self` in use declarations.


## Internal Improvements

* Major PSI rearrangements:
  - `Rs` prefix is used instead of `Rust/Element`,
  - argument-related PSI nodes renames,
  - more rules unified (by [@alygin]).

* Kotlin runtime and stdlib jars are no longer bundled.

* Type-related code simplified, stub data is almost always sufficient to
  compute the type.

* CI now runs both the latest nightly Rust toolchain as well as 1.13.0.
