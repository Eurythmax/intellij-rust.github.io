## New Features

* An action to execute a Cargo command
  ([gif](https://gfycat.com/SlipperyDemandingCrab)). You might want to bind it
  to a key combination.

* Better expand selection (`Ctrl+W`) support for lists (by [@alygin]).

* Goto definition and find usages for lifetimes (by [@alygin]).

* Better parser recovery in code blocks.

* Wrong usages of `self` value in associated functions are annotated (by [@sirgl])

## Fixes

* Fix colored terminal output (by [@jonas-schievink], [@alygin] and
  [@Stebalien], terminals are hard).

* Module-level live templates are not suggested in expressions.

* Watching Cargo.toml works again and has tests now.

* Formatter does not add spaces around `=` in `Iterator<Item=Foo>`

## Internal Improvements

* Run configurations refactoring (by [@mkaput])
