## New Features

* Automatically insert pairing `>` (by [@Undin]).

* **Variable does not need to be mutable** inspection (by [@farodin91]).

* **Convert to named fields** refactoring
  ([video](https://zippy.gfycat.com/SpiritedRealArieltoucan.webm)). Note that it
  does not fix the usages yet.

* In CLion, it is possible to chose between GDB and LLDB for debugging Rust code
  via usual C++ toolchain settings.

* Complete and resolve trait associated types (by [@Undin]).

## Fixes

* Path dependencies are treated as sources and not as libraries (by [@alygin]).

* More precise trait matching (by [@vlad20012]).

* Type inference for generic functions (by [@vlad20012]).

* One-liners are not folded if they exceed the line length limit.

* Resolve private imports via use declarations.


## Internal Improvements

* Switch to GrammarKit gradle plugin.

* Optimized type inference performance (by [@vlad20012] and [@matklad]).

* Separate slow running tests from the main test suite.

* Use `getContext` instead of `getParent` in resolve to allow for nifty tricks
  with injecting elements in arbitrary places.
