## New Features

* Simple **Convert to named fields** refactoring
  ([gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7buezkWc17ONpJNC/giphy.gif)). It
  was implemented a while back, but was not advertised enough.

* **Goto definition** works for traits inside `derive` attribute and
  for methods of the derived traits (by [@Undin]).

* More type inference improvements (by [@Undin]).

* Error annotation and quick fix for dereferencing a raw pointer
  without an `unsafe` block (by [@kumbayo]).
  
* Code formatter removes `{}` around single items in use declarations.

* Initial support for type inference in lambda expressions (by
  [@farodin91] & [@matklad]).
  
* Annotate wrong number of type parameters (by [@farodin91]).


## Fixes

* Fix false positives for E0198, E0060 (by [@kumbayo]).

* Pattern bindings don't shadow modules with the same name (by
  [@kumbayo]).
  
* Don't crash in **Implement Members** if there is nothing to
  implement.
  
* Fix project leaks in Cargo check annotator.

* Allow `use *` and `use ::*` in the grammar.

* Fix false positives in reassign immutable inspection (by [@alygin] &
  [@matklad])

	
## Internal Improvements

* Update versions of CLion and Gradle.

* Establish contributor license agreement
  ([#1385](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/1385)).

* Unify `trait` and `impl` handing during type inference.
